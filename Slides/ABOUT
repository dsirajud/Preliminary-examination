% The slides achieve a University of Wisconsin - Madison theme, which was created by minimal modifications
% to the beamer theme: https://github.com/quxiaofeng/PolyU_beamer_theme , so minimal that the original titling
% of theme/style elements and subfolders is kept as "polyu" rather than making any effort to retitle as UW-Madison
